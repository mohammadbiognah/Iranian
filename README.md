## About me!

Welcome! I started my PhD Candidate in Disaster Prevention at the Harbin Institute of Technology (Harbin), China, under the supervision of Prof. Shuang Li in 2022. My research focuses on advanced approaches to mitigate and prevent damages caused by Resilience Progressive collapse. I obtained my MSc. degree (2018) in Earthquake Engineering, at the Iran University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. Mohsen Ali Shayanfar. My master's thesis was “New Techniques for Retrofitting of RC Frame against Progressive Collapse”.

## RESEARCH TECHNIQUES

• Progressive Collapse.
• Performance Base Design.
• Tall Buildings (Analysis & Design).
• Explosion Effect on Structures.
• Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of Structures.
• Seismic Retrofitting of Structures.
• Structural Vibration Controls.
• NETWORK Resilience.
• Evacuation
• Disaster Prevention


## Skills 

• FEM: Ls_Dyna, Abaqus, Sap2000, Etabs, Safe, Perform3D, CsiBridge, Robot Structure.
• Earthquake: Opensees, SeismoSignal, SeismoMatch, SeismoStruct, SeismoBuild, Opensees Navigator, OpenSees Py.
• Programming Languages: MATLAB, TCL, VBA, Visual Basic, Python.
• NETWORK: GeNIe 4.0

## Experience 

•	Research assistant for Dr. Shayanfar at Center of Excellence for Fundamental Studies in Structural Engineering, Iran University of Science & Technology (IUST), Iran (M.Sc. Degree, 2017 {current}) 
• Cooperation with Barham Ali Engineering Faculty, Tishk International University, Erbil, Kurdistan Region 44001, Iraq, about Progressive Collapse. 2021 {current}).
